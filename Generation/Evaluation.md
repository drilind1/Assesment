1st Response from ChatGPT 4o:
Did not give detailed instruction on how to create the project it did not include the required project packages,
It did not have a separate response model to include a safe typed model instead it used a dynamic object which in this case I would not suggest.
Tha validation it is simple which is good, but I would rather use fluentValidation which is easy to add more validations and a lot of extra features are included
The error handling is not ideal, returning the exception message on the response is not ideal instead of that a generice error should be returned and the failure should be only logged as suggested by the comment.
The ChatGPT model used .net 6.0 version which is quite outdated this does not mean that it is bad and it probably is because chatgpt model does not have the latest data, this is not particular bad but would prefer that the latest LTS version be used like .net 8
It suggests to use a controller which for this scenario would prefer using minimal apis.
Over all this response is not good and has a lot room for improvement.

2nd Response from ChatGPT 4o:
It suggested to use `dotnet new webapi -n ArithmeticApi` which is a good step to start with, but this template also includes `WeatherForecast` example which the model does not suggest to delete this causes the docker image to be larger and builds taking more unnecessary time even thought this would not be very noticeable.
It uses minimal apis which is good but the response model is still dynamic so not good,
The validation could be improved instead of only checking for nulls and being inside the request model coudl be moved
Uses .net 6 outdated, would prefer that it used .net 8 since it is the latest LTS version
Did not create an easy maintainable structure of the project.
Overall this response works but it has a lot of room for improvement
