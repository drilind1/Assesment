Senior/Principal Engineer LLM & Cloud Screening Test
Thank you for your interest in this role! To help us assess your fit for this project, we’d like you to complete the following screening test. The goal is to evaluate your ability to leverage LLMs, generate and refine code, and validate it using cloud-based infrastructure.
You will have 3 tasks:

Task 1: Code Generation with an LLM
//1. Prompt Creation: Write a prompt to generate Python (or language of your choice) code that implements a RESTful API with two endpoints (e.g., /add and /subtract).
//2. Code Evaluation: Use any LLM you have access to (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude) to generate 3-5 different versions of the code.
3. Selection: Evaluate the generated versions, select the best one, and explain your reasoning in 200-300 words.
4. Enhancement: Modify the selected code to improve its performance or design (e.g., error handling, input validation) and highlight the changes made.
Deliverable: Submit your prompt, the generated code versions, your reasoning for selecting the best one, and your enhanced code.

Task 2: Cloud-Based Validation
1. Deployment: Deploy the enhanced RESTful API on any cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). You can use a simple service like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, or a more complex setup with Docker/Kubernetes if you prefer.
2. Acceptance Tests: Write 3-5 acceptance tests to validate the functionality of your API (e.g., calling the /add endpoint with specific inputs). Provide both the code for the tests and the results.
Deliverable: Submit the cloud deployment URL, the test scripts, and the test results.

Task 3: Write-Up
In 500 words or less, summarize your experience working with LLMs and any cloud architecture projects you have been a part of. Highlight specific challenges you've solved and technologies you've worked with (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker, serverless architectures).
Deliverable: A 500-word write-up.

Submission Instructions:
• Complete all tasks within one week.
• Send your code files, deployment link, test scripts, results, and write-up as a single zip file or via a GitHub repo link.
We will evaluate your ability to use LLMs effectively, the quality of the code you select and refine, your cloud deployment skills, and your problem-solving and technical communication abilities.
