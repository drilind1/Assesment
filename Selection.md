# Selection
So from the 4 of the [Evaluated Responses](/Evaluation.md).
I have chosen the [4th one generated using Claude 3.5 Sonnet](/Generations/4.Claude%203.5%20Sonnet%20(New)/response.md).

## Reasoning
The reasons of why I chose this response it is because of the way how a simple API Service with 2 endpoints was implemented with as less dependencies as possible and to offer all the required resources of implementing the requirements, also how good the structure of the project was suggested having the endpoints in a separate class and folder also the models and the validators it makes it a lot easier if this service needs to have more endpoints, models or validator that need to be used.

The Dockerfile is as the suggested example from Microsoft which is a good place to start from.
