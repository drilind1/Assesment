# Write up
## Cloud Development and Orchestration
I have spent a lot of time working with Kubernetes and Docker. My main tasks included:
- Working with Docker containers
- Setting up basic things like:
  - Networks
  - Storage
  - Load balancers
  - Resource limits

Some of the main challenges I dealt with were:
- Improving the performance of the deployed applications
- Fixing network problems between services
- Setting up monitoring to catch issues early
- Doing load testing against the cluster to find performance degradations

## Working with LLMs

I'm newer to working with LLMs, but I've used tools like ChatGPT and Claude to help me:

- Learn Svelte framework faster
- Debug code problems
- Write better code
- Learn new frontend concepts

Even though I haven't used LLMs for very long, they've really helped me work faster and learn new things more quickly.

## Looking Forward

I want to keep learning more about both cloud computing and AI models and personally the best way to learn I think is by working on them so having the opportunity to do this would be awesome.
