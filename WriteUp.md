# My Journey with LLMs and Cloud Architecture

## Cloud Infrastructure Experience

I've been in the trenches with Kubernetes and Docker for quite a while now. My day-to-day usually involves:

- Building Kubernetes clusters from the ground up (trust me, it's both fun and challenging!)
- Playing "firefighter" to keep our clusters running smoothly (those 3 AM alerts are always fun...)
- Getting my hands dirty with Docker containers - I've probably written more Dockerfiles than I can count
- Troubleshooting cluster hiccups, especially during those nerve-wracking peak traffic moments
- Setting up the backbone of our infrastructure, including:
  - Locking down network policies (because security never sleeps)
  - Making sure our databases have a reliable home
  - Keeping our load balancers happy during traffic spikes
  - Setting sensible resource limits (learned this one the hard way)
  - Keeping an eye on everything with monitoring tools

I've faced my fair share of challenges along the way:
- Nail-biting moments during app updates (please don't crash, please don't crash...)
- Wrestling with network issues between services
- Setting up monitoring that actually tells us useful things
- Squeezing the most out of our servers without breaking the bank
- Making sure our backups actually work (and not just exist)
- Juggling dev, staging, and prod environments
- Writing docs that people actually want to read

I've also put a lot of effort into making our deployment process less scary by:
- Making sure our tests catch issues before they hit production
- Having solid "oh no" buttons (aka rollback plans)
- Creating deployment guides that don't put people to sleep
- Setting up alerts that don't cry wolf

## My LLM Adventure

I'm still pretty new to the LLM world, but I've been amazed at how tools like ChatGPT and Claude have helped me:

- Get up to speed with Svelte way faster than I expected
- Get unstuck when my code decides to be difficult
- Level up my code quality game
- Wrap my head around tricky frontend concepts
- Write documentation that actually makes sense
- Break down complex tech concepts into bite-sized pieces
- Find solutions when I'm banging my head against the wall

Even though I'm relatively new to LLMs, they've been game-changers for:
- Getting stuff done faster
- Picking up new tech without the usual headaches
- Finding clever ways around problems
- Writing code I won't hate in six months
- Making sense of those cryptic error messages
- Building stuff that's actually maintainable

## Recent Wins

Some projects I'm particularly proud of:
- Found ways to stop burning money in the cloud by being smarter about our resources
- Created monitoring dashboards that actually help us spot fires before they spread
- Helped new team members get comfortable with Kubernetes (without overwhelming them)

## What I Bring to the Table

The skills I've picked up along the way:
- Kubernetes wrangling
- Docker wizardry
- Resource juggling and scaling
- Setting up actually useful monitoring
- Making deployments boring (in a good way)

## What's Next

I'm super excited about diving deeper into both cloud and AI. On my learning radar:
- Getting into the more advanced Kubernetes stuff
- Taking a shot at building my own tiny language models
- Getting my hands dirty with model training
- Understanding the magic behind LLM fine-tuning
- Figuring out how to deploy AI models without breaking the bank
- Learning about making models faster and lighter
- Building better ways to keep AI services healthy
- Staying on top of all the crazy AI developments

I really believe that mixing cloud know-how with actual AI development skills (not just using AI tools) is going to be huge. Can't wait to dig deeper into the technical side of AI while using what I already know about keeping systems running smoothly at scale.
